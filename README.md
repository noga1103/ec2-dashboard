If you want to sort, add "&sortBY=ATTRIBUTE" to the URL, and replace ATTRIBUTE with one of the following: Name, Id, Type, State, AZ, PublicIP, or PrivateIPs.

If you want the result to be paged, add "&page=NUM1&pageSize=NUM2" to the URL. You can change NUM2 to the number of instances you wish to be shown on a page, and NUM1 to the page number.
